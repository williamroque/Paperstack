#+title: Project Notes

* Goals

- Create UI using framework like Textual (though perhaps more cross-compatible)
- Pure command-based interface also possible (communication with other programs)
- Add papers easily (automatically/manually)
- Submit eventually to PyPI
- Automatically scrape from a wide variety of databases using a number of different identifiers (DOI, arxiv, Bibcode)
- Export selection/tag/filter to BibTeX, HTML, and PDF
- Portable, at least with respect to PDFs
- Good API/documentation
- Batch actions on selection
- Split screen to show information/notes for current item
- Since papers can be used in many projects, use tags instead of folders
- Allow notes in papers (markdown with latex) to be edited in any editor
- Strong search/filter system, including through paper notes
- TOML configuration file (e.g., editor command, DB path)
- Create folder with SQLite index and PDF files
- Add more document types than PDF
- Detect new files, add to index automatically by prompting
- Batch import papers
- Add websites and books to library as well
